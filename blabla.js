I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.,

As it is, Tolkien lived in a racist part of society, so the best we can really say isn't 'He wasn't racist at all' but instead 'He was impacted partially by the racist views people in his culture held but managed to avoid/lessen them in his writing in a way that is impressive when considering his circumstance'. If Tolkien wrote his books today, after living in a society with modern views on race, I doubt these passages would remain in any form. \n\nWhen you compare JRRT and JKR the amount of racism/antisemitism in Tolkien's work is surprisingly low, while the amount of antisemitism in Rowling's work is surprisingly high. (Personally, I don't think Rowling intended the goblins to represent Jews when she wrote her books, but instead borrowed mythical creatures from real European history which historical Europeans assigned similar negative traits to as they assigned to Jews. Having said that, she should have been able to tell how it would seem because of how blatant the similarities are).\n\n&gt;Since the anti-black/asian racism basically all amounts to a few throw-away lines, I'm willing to believe he would have been willing to change it to, \"there were other righteous people in those countries, this story just isn't about them.\"\n\nYeah, I agree with this, especially because the only non-white humans we see are the ones who DID follow Sauron, there's a lot of bias in the type of people we see who aren't white. If any of the story at all happened in these people's homelands we could make a better informed judgement on the nature of how they're presented.,

I recall the actual 'evil' races in LOTR, like orcs and trolls, were specifically created by Sauron and Morgoth to aid them in their own personal evil goals, rather than being evil 'just because'. i.e. they were specifically made with the intention of being evil, rather than being evil as some genetic trait.\n\nThere are SOME iffy parts of Tolkien's work (the orcs are described as having characteristics which are not favourably applied to Asians in some parts) but considering the environment Tolkien lived in, as an upper class British man in the 1800s and 1900s, he does very well on terms of race usually.

He handed Bilbo treasure and was perfectly fine with giving him his cut. The dwarves valued treasure, but it makes perfect sense they didn't want to share with jackasses.

body: "I don't know.  I keep hearing that Tolkein's dwarves are greedy, but i don't think it's supported by the text.  Thorin Oakenshield put together the Company of Dwarves to steal treasure from Smaug, but he didn't do it simply because he wanted gold and gems, he did it because that was *his ancestral treasure*, which was rightfully his, and which would contribute to his status as King under the Mountain if he could take it.  I believe this also contributes to Thorin's refusal to give some of the treasure to the men and elves that demanded it, because he is king, and will not be pushed around or made demands of. From this perspective, Thorin's major flaw isn't greed, it's pride.  \n\nIt's also worth noting that greed isn't unique to dwarves in the story.  The elves, the men of Lakewood, and the orcs, are all greedy for the treasure, but they don't have the same reputation for greed as the dwarves.,

Did they claim that they only supported the Dark Lord because they were under duress? Did they receive some sort of leniency for Draco helping Harry in Malfory Manor or Narcissa lying for him in the Forbidden Forest? Were there Nuremberg-esque trials to hold Death Eaters to account for their crimes?,

He did spend a lifetime repenting and working as a double agent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I think is the more interesting question relates to how the Malfoys were punished for their crimes post-Deathly Hallows. Did they claim that they only supported the Dark Lord because they were under duress? Did they receive some sort of leniency for Draco helping Harry in Malfory Manor or Narcissa lying for him in the Forbidden Forest? Were there Nuremberg-esque trials to hold Death Eaters to account for their crimes?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;,

He represented, writes Brackmann, “a radical shift in the characterization of the Dwarves.” And Gimli was portrayed as a representative figure, not an outlier.,

body: "Im absolutely certain that Tolkien's dislike of allegory is less \"NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE IS IN THESE BOOKS! NO METAPHORS\"  Which is frankly preposterous. People write what they know and they know their lives rather well. I think the big thing eegarding Tolkien and Allegory is his dislike of *exclusive* parallels. As in \"the dwarves are Jewish and *only* Jewish.\" From reading the quote Tolkien wants people to apply any and all interpretations of his narrative.\n\nNothing is written in a vacuum. Our biases and experiences seep right into it, whether we want to or not, even Tolkien himself. That said, there is a prospect of Death of the Author, not as a means of rejecting intent and context, but instead accepting new perspectives and interpretations in addition to that of the creator's, for they're a reader too.,

NO METAPHORS&amp;quot;  Which is frankly preposterous. People write what they know and they know their lives rather well. I think the big thing eegarding Tolkien and Allegory is his dislike of &lt;em&gt;exclusive&lt;/em&gt; parallels. As in &amp;quot;the dwarves are Jewish and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Jewish.&amp;quot; From reading the quote Tolkien wants people to apply any and all interpretations of his narrative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing is written in a vacuum. Our biases and experiences seep right into it, whether we want to or not, even Tolkien himself. That said, there is a prospect of Death of the Author, not as a means of rejecting intent and context, but instead accepting new perspectives and interpretations in addition to that of the creator&amp;#39;s, for they&amp;#39;re a reader too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;,
